            <p>You've worked so, so hard.</p>
            <p>You were the top of your class in school. People have always envied your drive and willpower. They said
                you were destined for great things. So why? Why do you still have this hole in your heart? </p>
            <p>You're on a beach by your family home, where you grew up. You're spending a lot of time here lately.
                Thinking about that hole inside you. Trying to problem solve your way to happiness. Nothing. It's all
                just more weight.</p>
            <p>It's all just more work.</p>
            <p>Today is different. You wont take responsibility again. You can't take any more responsibility. It's all
                so heavy. Life is so heavy. You look up at the vast sky, and it's emptiness is reflected inside of you.
