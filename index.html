                You've worked so, so hard.
                You were the top of your class in school. People have always envied your drive and willpower. They said
                you were destined for great things. So why? Why do you still have this hole in your heart?
                You're on a beach by your family home, where you grew up. You're spending a lot of time here lately.
                Thinking about that hole inside you. Trying to problem solve your way to happiness. Nothing. It's all
                just more weight. It's all just more work.
                Today is different. You wont take responsibility again. You can't take any more responsibility. It's all
                so heavy. Life is so heavy. You look up at the vast sky, and it's emptiness is reflected inside of you.
                'Please, if there's anybody out there. Help me. I don't know how to fill this void'

                You're jolted out of your daze by a sharp pain in your arm. it looks like sand crab crawled underneath

                You move to flick the creature towards the ocean and get back to the problems of your heart. But... You
                hesitate. He scuttles towards you again, and this time you don't flinch. Those elegant legs, the
                perfect, purposeful shuffle. The light crackling of his crabdomen dragging against the tiny pieces of
                crystalized sand.

                Those eyes... In those eyes, you see the reflection of the whole universe. You see your life, every
                success, every heartbreak, every day that the bottomless black pit swalowed you deeper and deeper.
                You're there now, falling and falling, the world a mere blip miles above you, endlessly drowning.
                A claw.
                A breath of fresh air.
                Time begins again.

                The sun is shining. You feel it's warmth on your skin.
                You feel. You feel more than you remembered you knew how to feel.
                The crab scurries back towards the ocean.
                Your eyes are dry. How long have you been crying?
