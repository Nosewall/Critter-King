            <p>You were the top of your class in school. People have always envied your drive and willpower. They said

            <p>You're on a beach by your family home, where you grew up. You're spending a lot of time here lately.
                Thinking about that hole inside you. Trying to problem solve your way to happiness. Nothing. It's all
